# Cluster Capacity Management Dashboard

## Project Objective
The **Cluster Capacity Management Dashboard** provides insights into the capacity utilization of different clusters within Ace Infra's IT infrastructure. By visualizing key metrics, such as VM counts, memory utilization, CPU utilization, and storage allocation, the dashboard helps the Ace Infra Team make informed decisions about resource allocation and optimization.

## Dashboard Highlights

### Page 1: Monthly Cluster Capacity Status
- **VM Counts**: Displays the number of virtual machines (VMs) for each cluster.
- **Memory Utilization**: Shows the percentage of memory used by each cluster.
- **CPU Utilization**: Tracks CPU usage across clusters.
- **Storage Allocation**: Illustrates storage utilization.
- **Thresholds**: Indicates maximum capacity allowed for each metric.

### Page 2: Overview
- Provides a holistic view of memory utilization, CPU utilization, and storage allocation across the three clusters:
  - **Academy Cluster**
  - **Backbone Cluster**
  - **DMZ Cluster**
- Helps identify trends and potential areas for optimization.

### Page 3: Weekly Distribution
- Breaks down capacity metrics on a weekly basis.
- Allows for fine-grained analysis of resource usage patterns.

### Pages 4-6: Individual Cluster Details
- Each page focuses on one specific cluster (Academy, Backbone, or DMZ).
- Provides detailed insights into VM counts, memory utilization, CPU usage, and storage allocation.
- Helps identify outliers, anomalies, and areas for improvement.

## Key Learnings

1. **Resource Utilization Awareness**:
   - Understand the importance of monitoring and managing resource utilization in IT infrastructure.
   - Recognize the impact of VM counts, memory, CPU, and storage on overall system performance.

2. **Threshold Setting**:
   - Learn how to set appropriate thresholds for capacity metrics.
   - Understand the significance of staying within these thresholds to avoid performance bottlenecks.

3. **Data Visualization Skills**:
   - Gain experience in creating effective visualizations (charts, graphs) to convey complex information.
   - Learn how to choose the right visualization type for different metrics.

4. **Cluster-Specific Insights**:
   - Analyze individual clusters (Academy, Backbone, DMZ) to identify specific resource allocation patterns.
   - Use these insights to optimize resource allocation and improve efficiency.

5. **Weekly Trends Analysis**:
   - Understand the value of analyzing capacity metrics on a weekly basis.
   - Identify recurring patterns or irregularities that may require attention.

6. **Decision-Making Based on Data**:
   - Appreciate the role of data-driven decision-making in resource management.
   - Use the dashboard insights to allocate resources effectively and proactively.
